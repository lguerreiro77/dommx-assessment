  name: "Data Operations (DSO)"
  description: >
    This domain evaluates the formalization of operational data handling, the stability of data lifecycle processes (creation, transformation, and usage), and the integration of governance controls into daily operational routines. Data Operations focus on ensuring that data management principles are translated into repeatable, efficient, and governed activities that support organizational continuity (DAMA-DMBOK2, Chapter 6).

maturity_scale:

  0:
    maturity_level: "Non-existent"
    meaning: "No governance practices and no defined responsibilities or processes."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Indicates a complete absence of structure and an immediate need for foundational action."

  1:
    maturity_level: "Initial"
    meaning: "Activities occur informally and reactively with little or no documentation."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Reflects awareness, but also high variability and operational risk."

  2:
    maturity_level: "Emerging"
    meaning: "Some practices exist but remain inconsistent, undocumented, or not adopted across teams."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Shows early development. Standardization and documentation are necessary to progress."

  3:
    maturity_level: "Established"
    meaning: "Processes, roles, and policies are defined, documented, and applied with stability."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Demonstrates operational consistency and readiness for more structured improvements."

  4:
    maturity_level: "Managed"
    meaning: "Governance is integrated into workflows and supported by tools, monitoring, and oversight."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents mature adoption with reliable execution across teams."

  5:
    maturity_level: "Optimized"
    meaning: "Governance is fully embedded, continuously improved, and aligned with compliance and ethical expectations."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents advanced maturity with proactive governance, optimization, and institutionalized continuous improvement."
