  name: "Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence (DWBI)"
  description: >
    This domain evaluates the governance of analytical assets, semantic layers, consumption standards, and decision-support structures. It examines how analytical outputs are validated, monitored, and aligned with organizational meaning, ensuring that insights are consistent, traceable, and used ethically. Governance must extend beyond data sources to analytical interpretation, reinforcing reliability, accountability, and transparency (DAMA-DMBOK2, Chapter 11).

maturity_scale:

  0:
    maturity_level: "Non-existent"
    meaning: "No governance practices and no defined responsibilities or processes."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Indicates a complete absence of structure and an immediate need for foundational action."

  1:
    maturity_level: "Initial"
    meaning: "Activities occur informally and reactively with little or no documentation."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Reflects awareness, but also high variability and operational risk."

  2:
    maturity_level: "Emerging"
    meaning: "Some practices exist but remain inconsistent, undocumented, or not adopted across teams."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Shows early development. Standardization and documentation are necessary to progress."

  3:
    maturity_level: "Established"
    meaning: "Processes, roles, and policies are defined, documented, and applied with stability."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Demonstrates operational consistency and readiness for more structured improvements."

  4:
    maturity_level: "Managed"
    meaning: "Governance is integrated into workflows and supported by tools, monitoring, and oversight."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents mature adoption with reliable execution across teams."

  5:
    maturity_level: "Optimized"
    meaning: "Governance is fully embedded, continuously improved, and aligned with compliance and ethical expectations."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents advanced maturity with proactive governance, optimization, and institutionalized continuous improvement."
