  description: >
    Items in this domain assess architectural principles, the presence of reference data architecture, the integration of business and data perspectives, and the alignment of structural definitions with organizational strategies. These elements are foundational mechanisms that enable scalable, sustainable governance. Research consistently shows that data architecture functions as a core structural layer that supports interoperability, consistency, lifecycle governance, and the controlled evolution of data assets across the enterprise (Legner et al., 2020)

maturity_scale:

  0:
    maturity_level: "Non-existent"
    meaning: "No governance practices and no defined responsibilities or processes."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Indicates a complete absence of structure and an immediate need for foundational action."

  1:
    maturity_level: "Initial"
    meaning: "Activities occur informally and reactively with little or no documentation."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Reflects awareness, but also high variability and operational risk."

  2:
    maturity_level: "Emerging"
    meaning: "Some practices exist but remain inconsistent, undocumented, or not adopted across teams."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Shows early development. Standardization and documentation are necessary to progress."

  3:
    maturity_level: "Established"
    meaning: "Processes, roles, and policies are defined, documented, and applied with stability."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Demonstrates operational consistency and readiness for more structured improvements."

  4:
    maturity_level: "Managed"
    meaning: "Governance is integrated into workflows and supported by tools, monitoring, and oversight."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents mature adoption with reliable execution across teams."

  5:
    maturity_level: "Optimized"
    meaning: "Governance is fully embedded, continuously improved, and aligned with compliance and ethical expectations."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents advanced maturity with proactive governance, optimization, and institutionalized continuous improvement."
