  id: 7
  name: "Document And Content Management (DCM)"
  description: >
    This domain examines the formalization of document and content handling, the existence of governed lifecycle processes (retention, archival, and disposal), and the integration of governance controls into unstructured data routines. Document and Content Management focus on ensuring that unstructured data is authentic, accessible, and governed throughout its lifecycle (DAMA-DMBOK2, Chapter 7).

maturity_scale:

  0:
    maturity_level: "Non-existent"
    meaning: "No governance practices and no defined responsibilities or processes."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Indicates a complete absence of structure and an immediate need for foundational action."

  1:
    maturity_level: "Initial"
    meaning: "Activities occur informally and reactively with little or no documentation."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Reflects awareness, but also high variability and operational risk."

  2:
    maturity_level: "Emerging"
    meaning: "Some practices exist but remain inconsistent, undocumented, or not adopted across teams."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Shows early development. Standardization and documentation are necessary to progress."

  3:
    maturity_level: "Established"
    meaning: "Processes, roles, and policies are defined, documented, and applied with stability."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Demonstrates operational consistency and readiness for more structured improvements."

  4:
    maturity_level: "Managed"
    meaning: "Governance is integrated into workflows and supported by tools, monitoring, and oversight."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents mature adoption with reliable execution across teams."

  5:
    maturity_level: "Optimized"
    meaning: "Governance is fully embedded, continuously improved, and aligned with compliance and ethical expectations."
    interpretation_for_assessment: "Represents advanced maturity with proactive governance, optimization, and institutionalized continuous improvement."
