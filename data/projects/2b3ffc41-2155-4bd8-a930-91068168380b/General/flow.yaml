    This file defines the sequential order of the domains of the DOMMx Model
    according to the official structure. Execution follows the Domain ID, based in DAMA and others.

orchestration_rules:
  - rule_1: "The assessment must be conducted in sequential order from 1 to 12."
  - rule_2: "The Decision Tree result for each domain determines the immediate entry point into the corresponding Action Catalog."
  - rule_3: "Names and acronyms must be preserved to ensure consistency with the official DOMMx documentation."
