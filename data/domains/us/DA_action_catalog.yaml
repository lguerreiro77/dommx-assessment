        deliverable: "Architecture improvement plan"
        recommendations:
          - "Maintain improvement cycles using DAMA guidance for governance evolution and architectural refinement (Chapter 3.6, p. 64)."
          - "Ensure feedback loops incorporate metadata, quality, and semantic insights from DAMA (Chapters 10 and 11)."
          - "Validate improvement actions against lifecycle roles and checkpoints (Chapter 4.3, p. 92)."
          - "Confirm documentation follows DAMA artefact structure (Chapter 3 Appendix, p. 69–70)."
        notes:
          - "Use DCAM capability evolution mapping to prioritize long-term gains in architectural maturity."
