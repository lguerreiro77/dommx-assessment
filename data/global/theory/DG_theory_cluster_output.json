This procedure will guide practitioners through the steps necessary to ensure that issues are reported, categorized, resolved, and documented in a governance issue resolution register. By adhering to the guidelines set forth by DAMA and incorporating CMMI corrective action practices, organizations can create a repeatable and efficient process for managing governance issues. This will not only enhance accountability but also ensure that data governance standards are upheld across the organization.\n\nThe first step involves setting up an issue reporting mechanism that allows stakeholders to report governance issues easily. This mechanism should be accessible and user-friendly, ensuring that all relevant parties can contribute. Once an issue is reported, it must be categorized according to DAMA rule types, such as data definition issues, quality breaches, and policy deviations. This categorization is crucial for prioritizing issues and determining the appropriate resolution path. Next, the designated data stewards and owners must validate that they are acting in accordance with DAMA lifecycle checkpoints when addressing these issues, ensuring that all necessary steps are followed for effective resolution.\n\nFollowing the categorization and validation, the issue resolution process should include thorough metadata and quality checks, as outlined in DAMA's guidance.
