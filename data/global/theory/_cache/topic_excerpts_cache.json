Edwards Deming [Deming 1986], Phillip Crosby [Crosby 1979], and Joseph Juran [Juran 1988]. Watts Humphrey, Ron Radice, and others extended these principles even further and began applying them to so ftware in their work at IBM and the SEI [Humphrey 1989]. Humphrey’s book, Managing the Software Process , provides a description of the basic principles and concepts on which many of the capability maturity models (CMMs®) are based.
