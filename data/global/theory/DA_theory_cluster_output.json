Begin by convening the defined forums, which should include key stakeholders such as data architects, data stewards, and business representatives. These forums will serve as the primary decision-making bodies for reviewing architecture standards and structural rules. The first step is to prepare an agenda that outlines the specific architecture standards to be reviewed, ensuring that all participants are aware of the topics and can prepare accordingly. \n\nNext, initiate the review process by validating the lifecycle impact of the proposed architecture changes. Utilize DAMA checkpoints to assess the implications of these changes across the creation, transformation, and retirement phases of data management. This step is crucial for understanding how the proposed standards will affect existing data processes and systems. Following this, conduct a thorough review of the semantic and metadata consistency of the architecture standards. This involves checking that all metadata definitions align with DAMA expectations, ensuring clarity and consistency across the organization.\n\nThroughout the review cycle, document all decisions and discussions meticulously. This documentation should adhere to DAMA artifact conventions, capturing the rationale behind each decision and any dissenting opinions. After the review, compile the first review minutes, which should summarize the discussions, decisions made, and any action items identified. This document will serve as a reference for future reviews and will help maintain accountability among stakeholders.\n\nSteps:  \n1) Convene the defined forums.  \n   - Actions: Identify and invite key stakeholders; schedule the review meeting.  \n   - Intermediate Output: Meeting agenda and participant list.  \n\n2) Prepare the review agenda.  \n   - Actions: Outline specific architecture standards to be reviewed; distribute agenda to participants.  \n   - Intermediate Output: Finalized agenda document.  \n\n3) Validate lifecycle impact.  \n   - Actions: Apply DAMA checkpoints to assess implications of proposed changes; gather input from stakeholders.  \n   - Intermediate Output: Lifecycle impact assessment report.  \n\n4) Review semantic and metadata consistency.  \n   - Actions: Cross-check metadata definitions against DAMA expectations; document findings.  \n   - Intermediate Output: Consistency review report.  \n\n5) Document decisions and discussions.  \n   - Actions: Record minutes during the review meeting; ensure all decisions are captured accurately.  \n   - Intermediate Output: Draft review minutes.  \n\n6) Compile and distribute first review minutes.  \n   - Actions: Finalize the minutes; distribute to all stakeholders for feedback and approval.  \n   - Intermediate Output: Approved first review minutes.  \n\nClosing:  \nUpon completion of these steps, ensure that the first review minutes are finalized and distributed to all relevant stakeholders.
