  description: >
    This file defines the structurally ordered domains of the DOMMx Model.
    Dependencies include reflexive and transitive structural prerequisites
    to ensure maturity coherence validation across domains.

orchestration_rules:
  - rule_1: "The assessment must be conducted in sequential structural order."
  - rule_2: "Maturity incoherence must be flagged when a domain exceeds any structural dependency by two or more levels."
  - rule_3: "Names and acronyms must remain aligned with the official DOMMx documentation."
