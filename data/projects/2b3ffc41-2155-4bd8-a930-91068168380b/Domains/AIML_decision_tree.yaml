domain:
  id: 12
  name: "AI and Machine Learning (AIML)"
  description: >
    This domain evaluates the governance of algorithmic systems, model risk, transparency, and the ethical use of data-driven systems. It addresses documented gaps in governing AI/ML when business-critical or subject to regulatory scrutiny. Functionally grounded in DAMA-DMBOK2 Chapter 14, it is complemented by DCAM for model risk and CMMI for process consistency across the model lifecycle.

maturity_scale:

  0:
    maturity_level: "Non-existent"
