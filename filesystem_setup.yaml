# DOMMx - File System and Directory Structure Setup
# This file maps the internal directory structure and the master orchestration entry point.

project_root:
  name: "DOMMx_Framework_v1_1"
  version: "1.1"

# Master Orchestration Entry Point
# The application must load this file first to understand the execution sequence.
orchestrator_config:
  main_flow: "general/flow.yaml"  
  main_orchestration: "general/default_execution.yaml"  
  main_domain: "domains/"
  base_directory_logic: "Root-Relative"

# Technical Note:
# 1. Acronyms must match precisely between directory names and YAML 'acronym' keys.
# 2. The engine should use the naming_convention to dynamically load files based on the Flow.yaml sequence.
