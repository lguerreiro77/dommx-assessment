          - "Compare patterns across domains to identify where integration design or standards are insufficient (“Chapter 8, p. 252–260”)."
          - "Validate lifecycle implications such as repeated backfills or extended retention of staging data (“Chapter 4.3, p. 92”)."

        prerequisite: "Requires trend analysis"
        deliverable: "Updated integration standards and patterns"
        recommendations:
          - "Refine standards to address repeated issues such as schema drift, ambiguous semantics, or excess duplication, in line with DAMA (“Chapter 8, p. 252–260”; “Chapter 10, p. 282–284”)."
          - "Ensure that changes to standards also update metadata models and pipeline templates (“Chapter 9, p. 236–239”)."
          - "Validate that revised standards remain consistent with lifecycle, quality, and security expectations (“Chapter 4.3, p. 92”; “Chapter 11, p. 308–311”)."
          - "Record approvals and versioning of updated standards according to DAMA documentation rules (“Chapter 3 Appendix, p. 69–70”)."
        notes:
          - "Use CMMI continuous improvement approaches to plan incremental but measurable enhancements."

        prerequisite: "Requires integration maturity profile"
        deliverable: "Integration benchmark evidence"
        recommendations:
          - "Benchmark practices against industry references and best practices, relating results to DAMA integration and governance principles (“Chapter 8, p. 252–260”; “Chapter 3.6, p. 64–66”)."
          - "Include comparison of integration patterns, lineage depth, and quality management (“Chapter 9, p. 236–239”; “Chapter 11, p. 308–311”)."
          - "Validate that benchmark outcomes inform lifecycle and risk decisions (“Chapter 4.3, p. 92”)."
          - "Document findings as governed artefacts in line with DAMA (“Chapter 3 Appendix, p. 69–70”)."
        notes:
          - "Use DCAM benchmarking guidance to translate external results into concrete capability goals."

      - number: 4
        name: "Enhance integration automation logic"
        prerequisite: "Requires DII-06 automation"
        deliverable: "Updated integration automation set"
        recommendations:
          - "Enhance automation by adding new validation rules, lineage checks, or orchestration safeguards based on DAMA and observed issues (“Chapter 8, p. 252–260”; “Chapter 11, p. 308–311”)."
          - "Ensure that automation changes update metadata definitions and documentation (“Chapter 9, p. 236–239”; “Chapter 3 Appendix, p. 69–70”)."
          - "Validate that new automation respects lifecycle rules and does not create hidden technical debt (“Chapter 4.3, p. 92”)."

        deliverable: "Integration improvement plan"
        recommendations:
          - "Maintain an improvement backlog that links integration issues, root causes, and proposed actions in line with DAMA governance evolution guidance (“Chapter 3.6, p. 64–66”)."
          - "Ensure that items include updates to standards, metadata, automation, and training where required (“Chapters 8, 9, 11”)."
          - "Validate that lifecycle impacts and risk reductions are considered for each action (“Chapter 4.3, p. 92”)."
